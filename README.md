# Bar Bot
This bot shows bars near the user location. Once the main button is pressed,
it shows markers in a static google map of all the bars near the user and
a menu to ask extra information of the bar.

## Technical info
YELP API is used to search information about bars.

It uses asyncio instead of threads to process much more requests asynchronously.

Python 3.5 or above is required.

PEP8 compliant.
